# Matchstick
This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.

# Description
The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.
This version generate a game board with n matchstick lines (1 < n < 100) and have a simple interface so that the user could play against the computer.

The AI is almost invisible !
I added a human vs human mode in 5 rounds.

# Usage
`make`

`./matchstick lines matches_per_round`
